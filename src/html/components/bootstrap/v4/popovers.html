Popovers rely on the 3rd party library Popper.js for positioning. 
You must include popper.min.js before bootstrap.js or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js
Popovers require the tooltip plugin as a dependency.
If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.

Popovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.
One way to initialize all popovers on a page would be to select them by their data-toggle attribute:
$(function () {
  $('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()
});

When you have some styles on a parent element that interfere with a popover, you’ll want to specify a custom container so that the popover’s HTML appears within that element instead.
$(function () {
  $('.example-popover').popover({
    container: 'body'
  })
})

You may define placement by data-placement="top" (right, bottom, left).

Data-trigger attribute defines how popover is triggered - click | hover | focus | manual. 
You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space. manual cannot be combined with any other trigger.
